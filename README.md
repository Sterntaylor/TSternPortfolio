This was a very difficult challenge as it made me recall everything used in Run-Buddy and apply it to a new project.
	The issues that I had with my Portfolio are,
		-Positioning of sections
		-Use of grid OR flex
		-Use of :hover and ::after
	These are things i've become more comfortable with,
		-Deploying a functional nav bar
		-Deploying application at a live url
		-Proper linking of imgs to CSS when in a different directory
		-Proper structure of HTML and CSS as far as media queries, header/footer
		-Use of justify-content vs Text-align. Justify-content is used within display:flex; while text-align works outside of a display:flex;
		-Use of :root and var()
		-Became more comfortable with Flex but the addition of grid made me confused. Trying to add in images to grid and have them sized properly mainly.
		-Found out how to use an img as a link

Things I will work on,
	-Paying closer attention to the modules and revisit this week's modules in order to become more comfortable
	-Attend all class periods(Mondays) in order to learn, get tips.

**Description of project**
This is a portfolio/showcase of how my coding has come along, it is still very rough and wouldn't impress employers but to me, my progress from not knowing anything
until now is astonishing. I have far to go to add more CSS elements and soon Java elements to my portfolio as well as other projects.
