        <p class="grid-item 2">Hello world! My name is Taylor Stern, I am 21 years old and I am just beginning my adventure into the world of coding. So far these last
            two weeks have challenged me more than I have been in a very long time. It was been ups and downs, the ups being debugging codes, things working out from putting
            it into the code to viewing it in the browser. The downs have been the very opposite, not being able to fix my codes and just stuff not at all working how I wanted 
            them to in the browser or my code not changing anything at all! Thankfully I have resources such as fellow classmates and teachers I can call upon when I run into such problems.
            <br/>
            The reason why I chose to go down the path of coding is hard to describe, there are many pathways that could lead me to higher income, remote working, and more time with family.
            However I decided on doing coding simply because no matter what on a day to day basis I, like many many others spend a good amount of time using or around electronics. It just made sense
            for me to go with the path that will(hopefully)impact many people.
            <br/>
            My goals, short-term in this adventure is to finish the course strong and find a job that will further my education as well as test my current knowledge.<br/>
            In the long-term I would like to either be working with a tech-giant such as Google, Apple, or Microsoft as a developer. While also doing free-lance work until I have
            an epiphany and create something that rivals the rest of the tech industry.
            <br/>
            I have a long way to go but as long as I use the resources that I have, learn and practice on a consistent basis, and to never throw in the towel. I believe these goals
            are well within my capabilities and my future.
            <br/>
            Thank you for joining me and reading up on who I am and who I want to become. Be sure to come back and see the progress of my coding adventure.
